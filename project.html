          <h3>01 Summary</h3>
          <p>

        <h3>02 Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Many of the current products in the market aim for business accounts by providing large storage spaces,
          <br>
          safe data sharing, and collaborative features. However, there isn’t a cloud storage platform is for designers and creative professionals.
          <br>
          1. Uploading any types of file may work, but it doesn’t mean necessarily users can open any file on the platform. There is a limit on what user can open or cannot open.
          <br>
          2. Waiting for response can be troublesome when collaborating. It’s hard to know when peer is going to review shared content and give feedback.
        </p>
        <h3>03 Solution</h3>
        <p>
          IconPlex allows users to upload and share any file regardless of type of size. Users can easily share work even if it's a large design file.<br>Not only users can upload and share any file but also have more instant feedback through the built-in messenger. The messegner allows users to communicate more instantly which leads to better collaboration.

          <h4>Branding</h4>
          <p>
            IconPlex is a combination of two words, “iconic,” and “complex.” IconPlex means that this cloud storage is not simply a
            <br>
            space where users store or access to content. IconPlex provides space for designers and creative professionals where
            <br>
            they can create content and collaborate to produce, “iconic” work.
          </p>
          <p>
            IconPlex portrays more of a professional image and seeks minimal and simple design. Sektches after sketches finally led
            <br>
            a simple but symbolic way to show IconPlex’s identity. Logo symbolizes the intial of IconPlex and complex or structure
            <br>
            which can be seen as icon.

            Wireframes are basic structure of a product. Low fidelity prototypes and usability testing was performed to improve
            <br>
            IconPlex. Creating original user interface was important since wireframes stage resembled competitors, probably an
            <br>
            influence from market research. It was also nice to hear how rubust ideas and features IconPlex has.

            Several rounds of testing on user interface design including a little detail as buttons helped to reach final design. Some of the user interface
            <br>
            have changed to serve users better.
            <br>
            Commonly, the participants appreciated the simple and minimal design of UI and stragight forward expereince on
            <br>
            performing tasks. However, all the participants had trouble understanding share button with only an icon, having activity
            <br>
            log on top in dashboard. And, lastly, the change for the location of messenger was required.

              After preference tests, final mock up came out as the most user friendly protoypes. Users appreciated
              <br>
              simple and minimal design approach all throughout the tests. Only the layout of dashbaord and collaboration section needed some
              <br>
              changes. By having different or more obvious buttons and layout chagnes, it improved the usability greatly.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          IconPlex has been a long journey after all. Designing a whole procuct was definitely a challenge. There has been so many
          <br>
          trials and errors to be where IconPlex is now. User testing and preference testing were absolutely beneficial and helpful
          <br>
          when developing a more well-rounded product in which learning how users feel using the product and what they desire
          <br>
          for an improvement while designer thinks his or her design will work well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there was more time given to me, I can focus on developing more on the features I desire to have for users in depth.
          <br>
          There is always room to add or change more after the project is done, or new ideas come up as it is close to finishing the product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I successfully delivered what I intended the product to be and through user test, I learned my intentions
          <br>
          and ideas were truly appreciated by users. I hope that IconPlex brings pleasure to users if this was fully functional.
        </p>
