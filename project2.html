            City Sports is a retailer of sneakers and urban fashion in Chicagoland for over 35 years. City Sports’ customers are passionate about sneakers so they line up or try to reserve their spots to purchase special sneaker releases.

          <p>
            Retail market needs to find new ways to attract customers in order to compete with online shopping era. Many retailers have their own mobile app to reach more customers and provide more convenience in shopping experience. City Sports’ current website (https://chicagocitysports.com) lacks brand identity and doesn’t reflect retail stores. Morever, there is no mobile app while competitors like Foot Locker, Finish Line, and Urban Outffiters already have their own.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="solution">
          <h3 class="problem-title">Solution</h3>
          <p>
            The mobile app is focused on sneakers that users can find their needs in special releases and check availability on products on both online and retail stores. City Sports’ mobile will provide users time saving and ease of access to product which make shopping experience more convenient with clear brand identity.

            <p>
              To better understand the eCommerce app for fashion and specifically for sneakers, I researched and analyzed competitors like Nike SNKRS, Foot Locker, and Urban Outfitters. In order to differentiate City Sports from competitors, it was necessary to have a specific focus and approach.

            <p>
              Nike manufactures sneakers therefore they offer more exclusiveness on products, informs users better with their key releases, deeper engagement with users through their stories. Moreover, entering the draw for its key releases appeals to sneakerheads.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Foot Locker specialized in shoes along with apparel, most similar business model to City Sports. Foot Locker carries wide range of sneakers and has member exclusive features such as certain offers and deals.

            <br>
            <p>
              Urban Outfitters is a retailer of fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products. The variety of products attract bigger market, but it can be overwhelming at the same time. The app features community oriented curation of content, in which users can share products and get help on deciding.

              Survey questions focus on understanding users’ behavior and attitude toward online shopping and how eCommerce app affect their shopping experience. For example, questions discover what users like about online shopping, how useful eCommerce app is, how eCommerce app is more convenient than websites. And, survey questions users to learn what the issues are for the current City Sports’ website and what users expect to see in the mobile app.

            <p>
              The brand, City Sports, has been in the market for more than 30 years. It is already well recognized business among customers in Chicago. Therefore, keeping the name is a wiser choice, and creating a new brand identity is necessary.
              <br>
              Therefore, I started to brainstorm to portray the symbols and imagery of sneakers and sneakerhead culture. Sports, the part of brand, gives off active and positive image to customers. I conceptualized the logo with its initials, CS, and eventually led to inspiration from shoelaces.

                City Sports' new brand represent itself to appeal to sneaker culture. People line up and try to reserve a spot to purchase sneakers that they want. Sunset orange represents the energy and passion for sneakers, onyx and white balance out the intensity from redn color (sunset orange).

                Lato provides a harmonious and warm structured feeling as body texts which helps users to sense stability when reading the font.

              With wireframes testing and branding, I created a high fidelity mockup in Figma and converted it to a clickable prototype.

            <p>
              There were another user testings for hi-fi prototypes. From these testings, I identified the needs to focus more on special releases, special release calendar icon, and pulling information when entering raffle.

          </div>
          <p>
            Although "sneaker icon" for new sneaker releases was appreciated, "calendar icon" would be more straightforward and easier to understanding

          </div>
          <p>
            In order to clarify what "New Releases" is, "Special Releases" is used. And, by providing dates, users can perceive the information on homepage and looping helps users to expect more upcoming sneakers.

          </div>
          <p>
            It is easier to understand using male and female model images to indicate these are "Men" and "Women" sections. And, texts in the original design get lost compared to buttons.

            City Sports was a project that I was eager to work on. As a former employee at City Sports, I was already aware of some pain points for customers. Also as Marketing Specialist, I felt the need of more efficient brand marketing and better engagement with customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was glad that I tested out my ideas and received feedback from users on earlier stages of the development. As it is a minimal viable product, the current product doesn't go deeper into some of the important tasks, for example, shopping experience overall. If I were to have a budget and time, I would test out competitors' shopping experience in order to compare and maybe come up with a better solution. I would add more functionality to customer service experience for taking care or orders and refine store-avilablity feature in detail.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another great discovery is that customer (users) wanted a more simplified and focused product. As an eCommerce app of existing retailer, I thought seamless integration of all business product was important. However, for City Sports, it was necessary to differentiate it from other businesses. And lastly, the launch of mobile app is already great for customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            I would be happy to see if the mobile app makes it to come alive as it goes beyond MVP through refinement.
