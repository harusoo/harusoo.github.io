            <p class="text-content biography">
              As far as I could remember, art had been my favorite stuff to do from a very young age.
              I was not sure why art sparked so much interest in me, but I truly enjoyed drawing and coloring.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-content biography">
              One of the earliest memories of accomplishment in art is when I won some kind of an award from art competition at around 6 or 7 years old. I remember that I did a watercolor painting of giraffes and tree with flower blooms in background at a zoo. Winning something with my own painting was very exciting and happy.
            </P>

            <p class="text-content biography">
              In the verge of figuring out what I wanted to do with artistic desire, Industrial Design came to me as a very interesting concept when I researched what it was about. Creating a physical form of solution to a problem with aesthetic quality was foreign at first because I didn’t think physical shape of product had anything to do with solving a problem. However, I soon realized everyday life is surrounded by design. People start and end a day with one of the most common products of design, “bed.” Design was so deeply rooted in daily life that I didn’t even notice at all.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-content biography">
              My design path had struggles to find ways of integrating aesthetic inspiration with solution to a problem. I even doubted myself if I could be a designer and asked myself why I want to be a designer. In the midst of struggles, I happened to read a mission statement of some company, “strive to impact on customers’ life.” Design changes the world which is amazing and such an honor to have an impact on someone else’s life.

            <br>
            <p class="text-content biography">
              As design trends come and go, it shows what is needed or what people want throughout years. Every design has a purpose that serves the need. From working in interior design and fashion retail, I bring attention to detail and tendency to create ergonomic design which can be transferred as focus on user-friendliness. I can help people from listening and observing their stories.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-content biography">
              Both Industrial Design and UI/UX Design have ‘focus on users’ in common. The concept of understanding and looking at products I’m designing from users’ perspective is something I am familiar with. Back when I was in Industrial Design, it was new and still unfamiliar, however, I can resonate with the concept so much better now. If design doesn’t have a purpose, it is meaningless.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-content biography">
              As I still have desire to express myself through design and sometimes through fashion, I would love to create designs with purpose while there’s still my own identity in it. I want to be a designer with timeless quality that users can always find it useful or practical. Let’s embark on this journey together to create meaningful changes.
